# Phonebook
Create your own phonebook!!

  1. OPEN VSCODE
    pull request the repository into vscode
    
  2. OPEN TERMINAL
    I have already made a makefile so just write: "make" in the terminal.
    
  3. FINAL STEP
    "./phonebook"
    
  4. Enjoy!!

(p.s. if you get an error looking like this "Makefile:6: *** missing separator (did you mean TAB instead of 8 spaces?). Stop"
Do the following: "manage" --> "command palette" --> "convert indentation to tabs")
